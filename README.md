### Features

1-✅ Reusability: No need to rewrite string functions; they are all encapsulated in one class.

2-✅ Encapsulation: The internal implementation of each function is hidden, so we can call methods directly on the object without worrying about their internal logic.

3-✅ Static Functions: Functions can be used directly without creating an object.

4-✅ Overloading: We created overloaded functions – one that takes parameters and another that works directly on the object’s value. This makes updates easy: if we modify a function, all dependent functions benefit automatically.

5-✅ Flexibility: Developers can either use class objects or call the static functions directly.
